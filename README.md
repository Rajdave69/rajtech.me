This is my website's React.js files.  
The final website can be viewed on https://rajtech.me

## Creation of Environment

##### 1. Create a Gatsby site.
Use git to clone the site and navigate into it:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Rajdave69/my-website my-project
$ cd project-name
```
##### 2. Install dependencies.
If you use npm 7 or above use the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag. If you use npm 6 you can use npm install.

```bash
$ npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```
or 
```bash
$ npm install
```

##### 3. Open the code and start customizing!
Start the site by running npm run develop.


## Running the site

1. Execute the command `npm run develop` in the project directory. This will start the site. 
2. Your site is now running at http://localhost:8000!
3. Open the localhost:8000 in your browser.


## Hosting (Locally)

1. Run `npm build` to build the site.
2. Copy `public` folder to the root of your project files.
3. Remember to set `siteUrl` in gatsby-config.js. This is the url that will be used to access the site.
