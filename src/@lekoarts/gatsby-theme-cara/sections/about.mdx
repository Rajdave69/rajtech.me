> Hello and Welcome! I'm Raj Dave

I'm a 14-year-old hobbyist Programmer and Photographer. I can code in various languages like Python and JavaScript.
I'm a self-taught programmer and love to learn new things.
I'd say I'm pretty good at anything tech related, which include Computer Hardware, Software and Networking.
