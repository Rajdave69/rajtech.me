Since my school had a bad circular system, with no API.
    I decided to make one on my own. The BPS API is an
    Open Source API that can get circulars from the BPS website into
    a list or the latest one based on Category, and much more.

I am pretty good at Photography too. Starting my journey with a Canon EOS 250D, I have been able to take pictures of everything from nature to portraits of people.
Learning to photograph was a great self learning experience. I learnt through various YouTube videos and tutorials.
I post my photography on my Instagram Page, which can be opened by clicking me.
