I am pretty good at Photography too. Starting my journey with a Canon EOS 250D, I have been able to take pictures of everything from nature to portraits of people.
Learning to photograph was a great self learning experience. I learnt through various YouTube videos and tutorials.
I post my photography on my Instagram Page, which can be opened by clicking me.
